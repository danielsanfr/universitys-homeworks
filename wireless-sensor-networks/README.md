# Wireless Sensor Networks Homework

_This is a homework of the Wireless Sensor Networks discipline._

This work trying to implement a very simple way, a form of data reduction in the transmission of temporal data in a wireless sensor network.

It was based on the article: [Prediction-based data aggregation in wireless sensor networks: Combining grey model and Kalman Filter](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~son/papers/Prediction-basedAggregation.CC2011.pdf).

## Implementations

The [first](https://github.com/danielsanfr/universitys-homeworks/tree/master/wireless-sensor-networks/first) was using C ++ and Qt. And it was the simplest and most trivial.

The [second](https://github.com/danielsanfr/universitys-homeworks/tree/master/wireless-sensor-networks/second) was using a simulator for wireless sensor networks called [JSensor](https://joubertlimadotcomdotbr.wordpress.com/jsensor-a-high-performance-java-simulator-for-sensor-networks/). For this it was necessary to study more, and better knowledge of what was being done, may apply the concept in the simulator.
