# Wireless Sensor Networks Homework

_This is a homework of the Wireless Sensor Networks discipline._

This work trying to implement a very simple way, a form of data reduction in the transmission of temporal data in a wireless sensor network.

It was based on the article: [Prediction-based data aggregation in wireless sensor networks: Combining grey model and Kalman Filter](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~son/papers/Prediction-basedAggregation.CC2011.pdf)
