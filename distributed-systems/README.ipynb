Já a segunda versão (**síncrona**), retornou para cada execução a mesma sequência de mensagens ordenada pela ordem de emissão da mensagem. Isso se deve ao fato de que após uma chamada remota síncrona a próxima chamada só será executada após o termino da chamada corrente. Já no B-multicast assíncrono todas as chamadas remotas são executas na saquência independentemente do retorno de uma outra chamada retorna e a mensagem é mostrada conforme ela é retornada._\n",
