# Distributed Systems

_These are homeworks of the Distributed Systems discipline._

Here is my Distributed Systems work at my university, [UFAL](http://www.ufal.edu.br).

**Used languages:** Julia | MarkDown | R

**Professor:** [André Lage Freitas](https://sites.google.com/a/ic.ufal.br/andrelage/)

## Usage

To view this job, simply click the [README.ipynb](https://github.com/danielsanfr/universitys-homeworks/blob/master/distributed-systems/README.ipynb) file. If you want to make any changes, just upload the [README.ipynb](https://github.com/danielsanfr/universitys-homeworks/blob/master/distributed-systems/README.ipynb) file to any folder on [JuliaBox](https://www.juliabox.com) environment and make the desired changes.

The results are in CSV files and plotted in graphs.

If you want to generate the results,  just update the ".csv" files existing with data from their tests on JuliaBox. So, assuming you have a complete installation of **R environment** on your computer (including `r-cran-gplots` package in the case of **Ubuntu**), just run the following command to generate the graphs: `Rscript b-multicast.r` or `Rscript r-multicast.r`.
